# Assignment3- In this assignment, I will normalize and optimize the database I created in Assignment 2.
Database normalization
Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to
minimize data redundancy.
Normalization involves refactoring a table into smaller (and less redundant) tables but without losing
information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The
objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in
just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
